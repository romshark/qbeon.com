			<h1 class="hide-full">We believe<br>in cloud technology<br>that is accessible<br>to everyone</h1>

			<p>Digital data has become the foundation of our modern life and society. People, companies and machines produce a lot of data that must be stored in a safe, reliable and centralized place. Our data must be available for us wherever we go on any device we use.

			<p>Computer technology has evolved and humanity entered the new era of cloud computing. Servers all over the world interconnected in a gigantic, ditributed network form digital clouds.</p>

			<p>Cloud computing addresses the <i>Big Data</i> problem. When the amount of data to be processed or stored exceeds the limits of a single machine then there is a need for technology that distributes workloads and data sets among dynamic clusters of machines on the network.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h1>The Cloud</h1>

			<p><i>The Cloud</i> is a buzzword for applications located on the internet that abstract away complex computational infrastructures and provide only a simple user interface.</p>

			<p>Applications like Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and many others represent the SaaS (Software as a Service) category of <i>The Cloud</i>, they abstract away the complexity of distributed and universally accessible file storages.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h1>There is a major problem</h1>

			<p>We lose control of our data we upload onto the cloud. It becomes accessible to strangers and may easily be viewed, analyzed, altered and removed without our permission.</p>

			<p>The cloud doesn't belong to us and therefore we cannot control it. Signing up for an account we are signing an agreement on the terms of use of proprietary services policies of which may change at any time.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h1>The cloud is just<br>someone else's computer</h1>

			<p>To preserve our privacy and protect our personal data we build our own centralized file storages for our companies and homes. While big companies and organisations run their own IT infrastructures maintained by professional IT specialists smaller companies and home users simply can't afford running their own IT departaments.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h1 class="hide-small">Personal storage devices<br>are meant to address this problem</h1>
			<h1 class="hide-full">Personal storage devices<br>are meant to address<br>this problem</h1>

			<p>Network attached personal storage devices have gained popularity during the rise of the cloud, they are however still very <b>difficult to setup</b> and use though, they require advanced technical skills, they still <b>aren't scalable</b> and they're still <b>not secure</b> enough, their user interfaces are <b>not consistent</b> across all the different platforms and their filesystems lack the necessary features for extensive collaboration and control.</p>
			
			<p>It is therefore not surprising that we still have to choose between rich user experience and our own security.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h1 class="hide-small">We want to solve this problem</h1>
			<h1 class="hide-full">We want to solve<br>this problem</h1>

			<p>Cloud technology is a powerful tool yet it's restricted to a handful of global companies, it's power isn't accessible to everyone. Building custom, private, distributed cloud applications for data processing and storage is a complex and expensive task.</p>

			<p>There is a need for a flexible cloud computing platform that is not necessarily bound to the internet and powerful yet controllable, dynamically scalable and secure. That's why for more than a year we work on a technology that eases the development of private cloud storage applications.</p>

			<p>Besides the <i>Big Data</i> problem there is a growing demand for a simple, yet scalable and secure personal file storage solution. That's why we designed a network attached personal file storage device based on our technology.</p>

			<p>It is very easy to setup and works right out of the box, simply plug it in and play it, no technical knowledge required. High level of security is ensured  through advanced encryption of disk and network communication.</p>

			<p>A beautiful and consistent graphical user interface across all major platforms like Windows, Mac, Android, IOS and Linux enriches the user experience. Sharing of files and folders with others is private, simple and intuitive.</p>

			<p>We developed a remote access technology that allows to securely connect to the Qube at home or at the office from anywhere over the internet without any network configuration right out of the box. Not only does our technology provide intuitive remote access capabilities, it also protects the Qube from external network threats and hacker attacks</p>

			<p class="description hide-full">The platform for dynamic<br>and distributed storage systems</p>

			<p>Just as Google's Android has become the main platform for applications on mobile devices - Qbeon QubeOS will become the main platform for distributed, secure and highly dynamic storage applications.</p>

			<p>QubeOS is an open source platform on top of distributed file- and messaging systems that abstracts away the pain of developing dynamic, distributed and fault tollerant applications on interconnected clusters of commodity hardware machines.</p>

			<p>Applications developed on top of the QubeOS API are isolated, secure, scalable, fault tollerant and interactive providing rich, cross platform graphical user interfaces. They can easily be packaged and published on the official app store.</p>

			<p>The Qube comes with 4 preinstalled applications developed by Qbeon: <i>Files</i>, <i>Users</i>, <i>Pictures</i> and <i>App Store</i>. In fact all preinstalled applications on the Qube are dynamically scalable. You can run these on small standalone machines, globally distributed groups of machines and even on interconnected data centers without noticing any difference in the overall user experience.</p>

			<p>Mass data storage is one of the fundamental building blocks of countless digital systems. QubeOS provides the flexibility and power for numerous fields of applications.</p>

			<p>Surveillance systems are a very good example of applications that can fully leverage the capabilities of QubeOS. Such systems generate a lot of data and provide real time streams of high resolution video material, they easily reach the limits of storage and processing capabilities of a single server setup and require a scalable and fault tollerant cloud platform.</p>

			<p>The growing amount of interconnected systems results in an exponentially growing amount of data. QubeOS is a scalable and reliable platform for the internet of things and smart home appliances.</p>

			<p>Social networking, messaging and collaboration software is yet another field of applications that require private and secure exchange of information on scalable infrastructures that QubeOS targets.</p>

			<p>Those and many more other types of applications can leverage the power of QubeOS. Developing applications is easy using the official QubeOS SDK as it abstract away the hazzle of building dynamic, encrypted, distributed and fault tollerant systems.</p>
